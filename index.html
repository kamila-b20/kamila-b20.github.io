<h1> Juliette Cuthbert, a monkey woman </h1>
<h2> The Monkey Lady 
<p> Juliette Cuthbert was born in 19733, and grew up in Tanzinia, Africa working to protect the monkeys. When she was 10 years old, her family abandoned her because they thought that she was abnormal. She grew up in the jungle for nearly 10 years all alone, until she moved to the US. She went to Cornell University. After she graduated college and got a masters in Zooology, she moved to the Amzon Rainforest in Brazil to work with Capuchin Monkeys. While there, she was attacked by monkey poachers, leaving her sick and weak in the jungle. Surprisingly, the monkeys rescued her and she recoved shortly after. She met Dr. Kamila Baker who took care of her and they shortly became best friends. Once she got old, she retired and was unforunately diagnosed with Monkey brains, a disease that makes you senile and very sickly, and had to move in with Kamila in New York City. Shortly after the move, Juliette fell fatally sick and died in the apartment. Her last words to Kamila were "I am a Monkey! ooh ooh, ahh ahh!" before she collapsed on the floor. 

 She is remembered to this day as the Monkey Lady, and is buried under a tree in the Amazon Rainforest. For more information on Dr. Cuthbert, visit her memorial in New York City.
